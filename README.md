# zuri-numberGuessing-game

Hello folks ðŸ‘‹. This is a task where I am required to create a number guessing game and connect my replit to my github
The project features allow you to:
1. Choose whether you want to play the game or not
2. Asks you for your name and stores it
3. If yes, selects random numbers starting from a range of 1 - 2
4. If you get it correct, it increments the range by one 
5. If correct as well increment the points the user got
6. If it is wrong it tells you the correct guess and tells you your total points
7. It then asks you if you would like to try again. If yes, the game is reset and starts all over from the range of 1-2
8. If no, signs you off and thanks you for playing the game ðŸ˜ƒ
